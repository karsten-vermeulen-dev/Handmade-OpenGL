# Handmade _OpenGL_

Handmade Workshop is a humble game engine framework designed as a teaching tool, with the added benefit of creating 3D graphical applications and games. With it, you can make a simple 3D game while learning OpenGL and C++ concepts. There will soon be a Udemy course that links to this repo.

More info soon.
